My name is Jakob /ˈjaː.kɔb/! I'm a cybersec enthusiast. I'm more focused in offensive security areas personally but working in SOC organisation gives me the insight and understanding of both worlds. Also, OSCP and GCFA do help to get better understanding as well :D

I play HackTheBox but under different account which I don't want to link right now. I have Guru rank and I am or been in TOP100 - depending if I'm not lazy enough to skip the latest machine 🙄

Right now, my focus is heavily put on website security. I do PortSwigger Web Security Academy and I enjoy it. My ambition is to actively start finding those bugs 🐛 on HackerOne.

Take care!
