Hi!

First post here. 

Setting all this up was really straight forward. There is neat GIF on the [beatutiful-jekyll repository](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) making everything super easy to follow. One thing mandatory to get this running - you **have** to push anything to `master` branch. This is why on the GIF they make changes to `_config.yml` file.

After pushing something, within seconds (max minutes!) your Github Page should be built.

Take care!
